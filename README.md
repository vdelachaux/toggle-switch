A very simple widget to display a modern toggle switch

![](readme.gif)

Use a toggle button for binary operations that take effect as soon as the user changes the state of the button.

Think of the toggle button as an appliance's on/off button: you press it when you want to activate or deactivate the appliance's action.

To make the toggle button easy to understand, use labels containing one or two words, preferably names, that describe the functionality being controlled. For example, "WiFi" or "Kitchen lights".
